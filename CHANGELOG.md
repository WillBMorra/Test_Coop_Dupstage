## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **yt-dlp maintenance.** DubForge reports the installed yt-dlp version and its
  age at startup, warns beyond 60 days, and offers a one-click update. The
  updater detects how yt-dlp was installed: a standalone binary in `tools/`
  updates itself with `-U`, a pip installation goes through pip. If a download
  fails and the version is older than 30 days, the log points at it as the
  likely cause — YouTube changes its delivery constantly and a stale yt-dlp is
  by far the most common reason for failures.
- **Logo** in light and dark variants (`docs/logo.png`, `docs/logo-dark.png`),
  switched automatically via `<picture>` and `prefers-color-scheme`. The dark
  variant lifts the wordmark to a light tone and the wave from `#4b24ed` to
  `#7c5cff`; on GitHub's dark background the original values reach only 1.10
  and 2.50 contrast, below the 3.0 minimum for graphics.
- **Screenshots** in the README.
- **`.gitattributes`** — LF inside the repository, CRLF on checkout for `.bat`
  and `.cmd`. Keeps `LICENSE` from showing up as fully rewritten whenever line
  endings differ between systems.

### Fixed

- **Read-only dropdowns were unreadable.** Their colours come from a ttk state
  table that `configure()` does not reach, so the light default background
  survived. Now set through `map()` with an explicit `readonly` entry, in both
  tools. The popup list is a plain Tk widget that ttk does not style at all and
  is now coloured via `option_add` — it would have stayed white.
- **Batch files had LF-only line endings.** cmd.exe handles those unreliably,
  particularly around labels and `goto`. All `.bat` files converted to CRLF and
  pinned via `.gitattributes`.
- Status text announced "converting to OGV" although MP4 has been written since
  the format switch; two dialogs still spoke of copying "into the game".

### Removed

- `Push to GitHub.bat` is no longer part of the repository. It is a maintenance
  helper, not part of the project. The push script now untracks anything that
  matches `.gitignore` but is still tracked, so the file stays on disk while
  disappearing from GitHub.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-10

First public release. Two Windows desktop tools, German and English interface,
switchable at runtime.

### DubForge — building packs

- Source from a YouTube link or a local file, limited to a chosen time span.
  The stream-copy cut is verified against the expected duration and re-encoded
  when it lands off target, because keyframe seeking is frequently inaccurate.
- Optional vocal separation with Demucs; falls back to the original audio when
  it is unavailable, losing only the backing track.
- Automatic clip detection from the loudness envelope, with adjustable
  sensitivity and maximum clip length. Long segments are split at their
  quietest point.
- Waveform editor: drag edges to trim, drag empty space for a new clip, split,
  rename, delete, listen. Mouse wheel zooms.
- Subtitles per clip. Enter saves and moves to the next clip, so a whole pack
  can be captioned without touching the mouse.
- Clips exported at −1 dBFS peak so that loudness does not distort the
  comparison later.
- Video written as MP4/H.264. Roughly four times faster to encode than the
  previous Theora path and about 40 % smaller.

### DubStage — recording

- Line-by-line workflow: hear the original, record over it, play your own take
  back, as often as you like. Any line can be left empty and keeps the original
  voice.
- **Comparison strip** — the original as a silhouette with your take drawn over
  it on a shared time axis, live while recording. Both curves are normalised to
  their own peak, so what you judge is timing and rhythm rather than level.
- Subtitles shown below the video, and running along as real subtitles during
  the final playback.
- Finale plays the whole scene with your recordings mixed over the backing
  track; export as MP4.
- Microphone test with level readout and playback.
- Video is split into JPEG frames once and cached instead of being decoded
  during playback, at 25 fps and 960 px. Playback timing derives each frame
  deadline from the start time rather than adding a fixed delay, which is the
  difference between a nominal 25 fps and 19 effective.

### Packs

- A pack is a plain folder. Each clip carries its start time in the file name
  (`07_MyLine_44-048.wav` = 44.048 s), subtitles live in `_captions.json`.
  No database and no binary index, so packs stay readable and hand-editable.

### Robustness

- Recording can never leave the interface stuck: button states are set before
  any drawing happens, the frame loop tolerates drawing errors, a watchdog ends
  the recording even if the loop stalls, and every phase carries a deadline
  after which the interface is released.
- Array lengths are aligned before mixing a take with the backing track.
  `int(len(x) / sr * sr)` does not reliably return `len(x)`; for roughly 8 % of
  clip lengths it lands one sample short, which previously raised mid-playback
  and froze the interface.
